    <h3>A message from the board of StartOut</h3>

    <p>
      For over 5 years StartOut has been a safe place for hundreds of young (and
      not-so-young) people to receive mentorship from our amazing StartOut Role
      Models via our digital platforms, as well as many tens of thousands more
      people we have interacted with at events all around the country and
      through our website and social media channels, however the challenges
      COVID has placed on our fundraising events and regional outreach plans has
      meant we have had to re-think how we move forward. While not the outcome
      we expected in early 2019 as we ramped up our efforts, the board have
      ultimately decided to wind down our own operations and are excited to
      redirect our efforts and funds and ‘hand over the torch’ so to speak, by
      supporting a fantastic new online program with a strong mental health
      focus and a far broader reach, in{' '}

    </p>
    <p>
      StartOut is a health promotion charity with a mandate to support groups at
      high risk of mental health issues, our focus being on supporting people of
      diverse sexuality and gender, who are still among the most impacted by
      poor mental health. When we first conceptualised StartOut there was
      nowhere online a young person could go to receive real support and quality
      advice that was free and focussed on early intervention where they could
      remain anonymous. Real role models were hard to find. Services were either
      in person or focussed on treatment of mental health issues rather than
      early intervention, and only really existed in major capital cities.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, more organisations and charities are investing at digital
      solutions, and more mainstream mental health charities are including
      people of diverse sex, sexuality, and gender as an important focus area of
      their broader strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through our research we identified a number of fantastic programs
      underway, some of which we’ve listed below, and through this process we
      have ultimately decided to partner with headspace, to directly support one
      of their online communities; qheadspace. qheadspace was launched in 2019
      to directly support sexually and gender diverse (DSG) young people and is
      a safe space for them to receive support and advice. The service is run by
      qualified peer moderators and mental health clinicians, and ultimately a
      very close fit to what we envisaged at the very beginning of the StartOut
      journey.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Steven Leicester, Head of Digital Mental Health Programs at headspace
        says “whilst it is sad to see StartOut Australia closing their doors,
        headspace is excited to be able to honour the legacy of such a fantastic
        organisation, and continue to support the mental health and wellbeing of
        young LGBTIQA+ and DSG young people. We are so grateful for the
        additional support”.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As headspace’s Online Communities are funded solely by private donations,
      fundraising and philanthropy, this partnership means qheadspace will be
      able to continue to run more programs and further support our community.
      StartOut will direct our remaining funds to support this great program and
      will recommend qheadspace as a place for our community and our fantastic
      volunteers to seek support.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      The program runs regular online group chat sessions, with qualified peer
      moderators and is overseen by mental health clinicians, and can feed into
      1 on 1 counselling services through eheadspace, . Examples of support
      provided by qheadspace can be on anything and can support on things
      ranging from navigating relationships, to dealing with family conflict, to
      how to be a trans ally and more. Over 250 young DSG people each month
      already find a supportive community in qheadspeace and we are excited to
      see the program flourish and reach even more people.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      qheadspace chats take place every Tuesday at 6:15pm (AEST), and all
      transcripts are available after the session. You can find out more about
